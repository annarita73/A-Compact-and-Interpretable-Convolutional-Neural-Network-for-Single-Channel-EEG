# A Compact and Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network for Cross-Subject Driver Drowsiness Detection from Single-Channel EEG 

The descriptions will be updated soon.

 THe data file contains 3 variables and they are EEGsample, substate and subindex.
 "EEGsample" contains 2022 EEG samples of size 20x384 from 11 subjects. 
 Each sample is a 3s EEG data with 128Hz from 30 EEG channels.

 The names and their corresponding index are shown below:
 Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FT7, FC3, FCZ, FC4, FT8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, TP7, CP3, CPz, CP4, TP8, T5, P3, PZ, P4, T6, O1, Oz  O2
